\# Wordle Game (Python)



This is a beginner Python project where I am building a Wordle-style game to practice and understand Python concepts through implementation.



Right now, the game works in the terminal and focuses on the core logic, such as taking a user guess and checking which letters are correct and in the correct position.



This project is being developed step by step. After completing the terminal version, I plan to extend the same logic into a GUI-based version using PyQt5.



The main goal of this project is learning — improving problem-solving skills, writing cleaner logic, and gradually building a more complete application.
